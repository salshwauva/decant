# launch-steam.sh — Start Steam inside the prefix with the flag set
# and DLL overrides that this project has verified.

#   1. Kill any lingering Steam / Wine processes from a previous session
#      (so the new one is not reduced to --silent by single-instance guard)
#   2. Wipe Chromium's SingletonLock (left over by crashes)
#   3. Launch Steam with DXMT-friendly DLL overrides and a set of
#      CEF flags that have been validated on Apple Silicon + wine-stable
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/launch-steam.sh            # attach and tail Steam's log
#   scripts/launch-steam.sh --detach   # fire-and-forget, just print paths

# shellcheck source=lib/common.sh

# -- 3. Build launch environment ---------------------------------------------

# WINEDLLOVERRIDES (reference: DXMT install guide)
#   dxgi, d3d11, d3d10core  -> native first, then builtin ("n,b")
#   These are the DXMT DLLs we installed in 04-install-dxmt.sh.
#
# Steam / CEF flags we pass
#   -no-cef-sandbox   Chromium's sandbox relies on Windows low-integrity
#                     tokens that Wine does not model on macOS. Disabling
#                     it lets the browser process start.
#
# What we deliberately do NOT pass
#   -cef-force-sw-gl / -cef-disable-d3d11 : these bypass DXMT entirely,
#      returning us to the black-window regime. They belong in an
#      emergency "DXMT is broken" debug runbook, not the default launch.
#
# The --in-process-gpu flag that DXMT requires is injected by the wrapper
# installed at scripts/06-install-wrapper.sh; it must be applied to
# steamwebhelper.exe, not to steam.exe.

export WINEPREFIX

# DLL overrides — hybrid configuration.
#
#   dxgi,d3d11,d3d10core=n,b
#     Keep DXMT in the override chain for *games*. Chromium's CEF
#     browser gets its own `--disable-gpu` (passed through the
#     steamwebhelper wrapper) so CEF never creates a D3D11 device
#     and DXMT never fires on its codepath. But Unreal / Unity
#     titles and anything else that calls CreateDevice directly
#     still needs DXMT to translate D3D11 to Metal — otherwise
#     those games die with "Failed to initialize graphics /
#     DirectX 11" at launch.
#
#   bcrypt=b;ncrypt=b
#     Force Wine's builtin BCrypt/NCrypt so Wine 11.0's stubs do
#     not collide with Chromium BoringSSL on Apple Silicon.
#
#   gameoverlayrenderer,gameoverlayrenderer64=d
#     Hard-disable Steam's in-game overlay DLLs. The overlay checkbox
#     in the game properties only stops the UI; the DLL still gets
#     injected into child processes and hooks D3D11. On Wine/DXMT
#     that hook makes the target game deadlock in CreateDevice before
#     Unity's `[Physics::Module]` log line. Turning the DLL into a
#     disabled override stops Wine from loading it at all.

#   -no-cef-sandbox       Chromium sandbox relies on Windows integrity
#                         tokens Wine doesn't model. Must be disabled.
#   -cef-single-process   Consolidate browser / GPU / renderer into a

#                         Chromium --single-process. Sidesteps DXMT's

#   -noverifyfiles        Disable Steam's executable-checksum integrity
#                         check. Without this flag Steam rewrites our

#                         launch (bootstrap_log reports

# Virtual-desktop wrapper.
#
# Without this, Wine's macdrv hands each Win32 top-level window straight
# to AppKit, so any game that asks for fullscreen takes over the whole
# display. Wrapping Steam (and everything it spawns) inside a single
# Wine `explorer.exe /desktop=NAME,WxH` virtual desktop collapses the
# whole Wine session into one macOS window and prevents games from
# punching into native fullscreen space.
#
# Sizing: Wine's virtual-desktop window is `WS_POPUP` / borderless by
# construction (see dlls/winemac.drv/cocoa_window.m), so macOS gives it
# no title bar. That means the user cannot drag it around — wherever we
# place it is where it stays for the session. The only sensible default
# is therefore "as big as the usable display", which we detect here via
# AppleScript on the Finder (it already excludes the menu bar).
#

#   WINE_VIRTUAL_DESKTOP=1024x768   explicit resolution
#   WINE_VIRTUAL_DESKTOP=auto       re-detect (same as unset)

#                                   per-window NSWindows again)
