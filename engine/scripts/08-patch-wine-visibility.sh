# 08-patch-wine-visibility.sh — Rebuild Wine 11's winemac.so with
# -fvisibility=default and drop it over the Gcenx wine-stable cask install.
#
# Only winemac.so is replaced; wineserver, ntdll.so, and every other file in
# the cask tree are left untouched.
#
# This is step 4 of 4 in the "fixes not available off the shelf" list.
# See docs/building-for-games.md for full context and the complete list.
#
# WARNING: The first run compiles Wine from source. Expect ~30 minutes of
# build time on an M-series Mac. Subsequent runs (sentinel-guarded) complete
# in seconds.
